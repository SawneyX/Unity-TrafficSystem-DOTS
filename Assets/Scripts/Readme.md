## Unity TrafficSim Dots

**Unity DOTS CitySim** is a performance-focused city builder prototype built with Unity's Data-Oriented Tech Stack (DOTS). This project showcases the use of the **Entity Component System (ECS)** for managing dynamic traffic systems, simulating cars navigating a grid of streets efficiently.

The simulation is designed to demonstrate scalable systems suitable for large-scale environments, with an emphasis on clean architecture, modular design, and data-driven behavior.

### 🔧 Features
- 🚘 ECS-driven vehicle spawning and movement
- 🛣️ Grid-based street layout system
- 📊 Data-oriented logic for high performance
- 🎮 Modular and extensible gameplay architecture
- 🧪 Built as a technical showcase for performance simulation and gameplay logic

### 🧠 Tech Stack
- Unity 2022+
- Unity DOTS (ECS, Jobs, Burst)
- C#
